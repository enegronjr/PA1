1. While programming I was not able to open the files. Also, all
the data was not being read in and was crashing before it finished.
2. To open the files, I had to make the variable type a FILE**
because I was passing them by pointer. The data wasn't being scanned
in and the program was crashing because I was not allocating enough
memory to the 2d arrays.
3. I liked the complexity of this assignment. Most of the other programs
don't require me to use much critical thinking but this assignment
required me to actually sit down and plan out my program.
